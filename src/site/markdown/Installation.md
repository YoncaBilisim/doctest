# Getting started
Go to the latest version at [maven central](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22com.devbliss.doctest%22) choose the build tool of you choice and add doctest as a dependency to your project or download the jar and include it manually. E.g if you are using maven just add the following dependency to your project pom.xml:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.devbliss.doctest</groupId>
        <artifactId>doctest</artifactId>
        <version>0.6.3</version>
    </dependency>

Once the doctest library is included to your project you can start writing *doctests* by extending *com.devbliss.doctest.DocTest*

# Wanna see what it does?
Have a look at the first introduction [example](Example.html) or klick through the already generated [doctest](Doctests.html) files.
